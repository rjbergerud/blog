Motivated largely by a love of the natural world, I'm interested in working in climate solutions.  I also enjoy revisiting bits of mathematics I learned in my undergrad, so that might reflect in some posts I make here.   

I completed a BSc Honours in Mathematics from University of Victoria in 2014, and a MSc in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2021.
